# Statistics One, 2013, Lab 8

# Lab goals
#   Conduct group comparisons
#     Dependent t-tests
#     Independent t-tests
#     Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

# Example
#  Working memory training experiment (N = 120)
#  The dependent variable (DV) is number of items answered correctly on an intelligence test
#  There are three independent variables:
#    Time (2 levels): pre and post training
#    Training (2 levels): training (1) and control (0) (n.training = 80, n.control = 40)
#    Training sessions (4 levels): 8, 12, 17, 19 (for each, n = 20)
