# Statistics One, 2013, Lab 6

# Lab goals
#   Read a datafile into R
#   Print summary statistics
#   Conduct correlation analyses
#   Conduct regression analyses, emphasis on models that include a categorical predictor variable

# Example
#   A correlational study investigating predictors of salary among University faculty members
#     Outcome variable (Y) is annual salary in US Dollars ($)
#     Predictors (X) are age, number of years as faculty member, number of publications, and academic department (History, Psychology, Sociology)
#     Sample size is N = 100


# Check your working directory
getwd()

# If necessary, set your working directory
setwd("/home/pothix/repos/pothix-codes/r/coursera-statistics-one")

# If necessary, install packages
# install.packages("psych")

# Load packages
library(psych)

# Read data into a dataframe called FS (Faculty Salary)
FS <- read.table("data/lab6.txt", header = T)

# If you want to view the data
# View(FS)
edit(FS)

# Summary statistics
describe(FS)

# Correlation analysis
cor(FS[1:4])

# Regression analyses, unstandardized
# Model0 demonstrates that age and years are, for the most part redundnant, so we will only use years in the next set of models
model0 <- lm(FS$salary ~ FS$years + FS$age)
summary(model0)

model1 <- lm(FS$salary ~ FS$years)
summary(model1)
confint(model1)

model2 <- lm(FS$salary ~ FS$pubs)
summary(model2)
confint(model2)

model3 <- lm(FS$salary ~ FS$years + FS$pubs)
summary(model3)
confint(model3)

# Compare Model3 to both Model1 and Model2 to determine if including both predictors is best
anova(model1, model3)
anova(model2, model3)

# Now let's conduct regression analyses that include a categorical predictor
# We need to use dummy codes to represent the nominal variable (dept) as numeric
# In R there are several ways to do this, the following is just one example, using the function C (for contrasts)
dept.code <- C(FS$dept, treatment)

model4 <- lm(FS$salary ~ FS$years + FS$pubs + (dept.code))
summary(model4)
confint(model4)

# Compare Model4 to Model3 to determine if including dept improves the predictions of the model
anova(model3, model4)

# Let's examine the salary difference between History and Sociology
# To quickly view the means, use the tapply function
tapply(FS$salary, FS$dept, mean)

# The actual means are not that different, so why are the means predicted by the model so different?
# There must be differences across departments in years and/or pubs
# Let's look at years
tapply(FS$years, FS$dept, mean)

# Let's look at pubs
tapply(FS$pubs, FS$dept, mean)

# The actual salary for Sociology is not that different from the other
# departments BUT they have more years on the job and more publications, on
# average, than the other departments, so their PREDICTED salary, based on an
# AVERAGE number of years and publications is lower, which is a more accuracte
# refelction of the discrepancies across departments.
