A simple snake game using Rust and ggez
=======================================

This is a simple game high inspired by the one @termnh wrote
([ref](https://github.com/termhn/ggez_snake)). My focus is to deliver a live
coding presentation of this game in the same way as I did for Javascript,
Python, and Ruby.

I tried to make it as simple as possible to be able to do most of the code in
50 minutes (had to start with some boilerplate code to draw the window). The
reasoning behind the talk is to show how cool is to learn Rust by making games.
