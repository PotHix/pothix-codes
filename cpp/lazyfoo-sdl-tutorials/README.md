SDL Studies
===========

This directory holds my SDL studies. The main idea is to follow [lazyfoo
tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/) to play with SDL a little bit.

At the time (2009) I was trying one chapter per week with my friend
[_leticia](http://twitter.com/_leticia) just to play with C++ and SDL.
When more than one person is trying the same thing the motivations grows
and so it was.
