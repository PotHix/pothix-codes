PotHix Random Codes
===================

This repository holds a lot of random codes that I've made using different
languages on the past years.

Between these codes you may find:

* Useful codes
* Study codes
* Hello words
* Not finished implementations

The main idea is to keep just one repository for all unfinished or test projects
instead of pollute my Github account with lots of no valuable repositories.

You may or may not find good things here. You should also prepare yourself to
see very old codes as well. :)
