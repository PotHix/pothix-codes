=begin  
 the first character of a name helps Ruby to distinguish its intended use  
 instance variable name starts with a @ sign  
 class variable name starts with a @@ sign  
 global variable name starts with a $ sign  
 constant name starts with an uppercase letter  
 Method names should begin with a lowercase letter  
 ?, ! and = are the only weird characters allowed as method name suffixes  
 ! or bang labels a method as dangerous-specifically  
 use underscores to separate words in a multiword method or variable name  
 Class names, module names and constants use capitalization

# Ruby is dynamic  
x = 7           # integer  
x = "house"  # string  
x = 7.5        # real  
  
# In Ruby, everything you manipulate is an object
